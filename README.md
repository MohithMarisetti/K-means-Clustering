System Requirements:
-> Python 3.x required


Steps to run the code:
1. Place all the files provided in a single directory.
2. From the command line run the program as $ python main.py

Output Explanation:
1. Cluster variances and Number of iterations to converge for k = 1 to 10
2. Plot of Distortion score vs Number of clusters (k values)
3. Accuracy score of k=3.
